# A2 Computer Science Algorithms 🧠

Hey there! 👋  
This repo is where I’m keeping all my A2 Computer Science algorithm codes.  
It’s mostly Python stuff — sorting, searching, and some OOP practice.

## 📁 What’s Inside

- `BubbleSort.py` → classic bubble sort  
- `InsertionSort.py` → another simple sorting algorithm  
- `Object-Oriented Programming.py` → some OOP examples  
- (more will be added as I go 👨‍💻)

## 🎯 Why I Made This

Just wanted a place to keep all my A2 algorithms together —
also helps me revise before exams and share code with friends.

##💡 Future Plans

Add more algorithms (merge sort, quick sort, linked list, etc.)

Maybe include some flowcharts or notes for easier understanding
